              comprehensive database that contains publicly available
              nucleotide sequences for 400 000 formally described species.
              These sequences are obtained primarily through submissions from
              individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale
              sequencing projects, including whole genome shotgun and
              environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using
              BankIt, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
              Submission Portal, or the tool tbl2asn. GenBank staff assign
              accession numbers upon data receipt. Daily data exchange with the
              European Nucleotide Archive and the DNA Data Bank of Japan
              ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the
              NCBI Nucleotide database, which links to related information such
              as taxonomy, genomes, protein sequences and structures, and
              biomedical journal literature in PubMed. BLAST provides sequence
              similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases.
              Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank
              database are available by FTP. Recent updates include changes to
              sequence identifiers, submission wizards for 16S and Influenza
              sequences, and an Identical Protein Groups resource.",

              submission to European Nucleotide Archive",
  author   = "Norling, Martin and Jareborg, Niclas and Dainat, Jacques",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The state-of-the-art genome annotation tools output
              GFF3 format files, while this format is not accepted as
              submission format by the International Nucleotide Sequence
              Database Collaboration (INSDC) databases. Converting the GFF3
              format to a format accepted by one of the three INSDC databases
              is a key step in the achievement of genome annotation projects.
              However, the flexibility existing in the GFF3 format makes this
              conversion task difficult to perform. Until now, no converter is
              able to handle any GFF3 flavour regardless of source. RESULTS:
              Here we present EMBLmyGFF3, a robust universal converter from
              GFF3 format to EMBL format compatible with genome annotation
              submission to the European Nucleotide Archive. The tool uses json
              parameter files, which can be easily tuned by the user, allowing
              the mapping of corresponding vocabulary between the GFF3 format
              and the EMBL format. We demonstrate the conversion of GFF3
              annotation files from four different commonly used annotation
              tools: Maker, Prokka, Augustus and Eugene. EMBLmyGFF3 is freely
              available at https://github.com/NBISweden/EMBLmyGFF3 .",
